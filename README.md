# dev-env-setup

My personal dev environment setup.

#Setup
Pull the changes from the main branch. It should work.

#How to manage configuration
Simply use command `dotfiles` and provide `args` similiar to how to use `git`.
Example:

`dotfiles commit -m "My next commit"`
or
`dotfiles rebase -i origin/main`
